## E-COMMERCE ADMIN PANEL

The goal of this project is to develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an e-commerce admin dashboard using React. The application will allow administrators to manage products through CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. The MVP will consist of at least three pages and use a mock backend for data persistence. This project is designed to help you learn React, REST API integration, and basic UI/UX design principles.

## Functional Requirements
The MVP must include the following features:
-Pages
-The application must have at least three pages:
(a) Products List Page:
-Display a table of all products with columns for name, price, stock, and actions.
-Include buttons/links for editing and deleting each product.
(b) Add Product Page:
-Provide a form to create a new product with fields for name, price, and stock.
-Include a submit button to save the product.
(c) Edit Product Page:
-Provide a form to update an existing product's name, price, and stock.
-Pre-populate the form with the selected product's data.
-Include a submit button to save changes.

## CRUD Operations
Create: Add new products via the Add Product page.

Read: Display all products on the Products List page and fetch a single product's details for the Edit Product page.

Update: Modify existing product details via the Edit Product page.

Delete: Remove a product from the Products List page.

## Navigation
Include a navigation bar with links to the Products List and Add Product pages.
Use client-side routing (React Router) to navigate between pages without full page reloads.

## Data Management
Use a mock backend (e.g., JSON Server) to simulate a REST API for storing product data.
Products should have at least the following fields:
id: Unique identifier (auto-generated by the backend).
name: Product name (string).
price: Product price (number).
stock: Available stock quantity (number).
